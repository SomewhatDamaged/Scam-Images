# Scam-Images
A list of images that are known scams that get posted to chat services. Please treat these like Co-60 and don't share them on rando servers. Drop and run!

I accept PRs with new images. Please use the script `create_image_folder.py` to create a folder, and make an `info.txt` file to state where you found them (or not, I'm not the boss of you).

Can recommend using something like [ImageHash (python)](https://pypi.org/project/ImageHash/) for comparing images. A hamming distance of ~4 should account for JPG compression without catching unrelated things.

If you lack the ability to post a PR, please send the images to: spam-images@excessive.space

An API endpoint has been set up: 

---------

Simple endpoint: `https://api.excessive.space/v1/hashcompare?hash=<64char_hash>`

This will return json with either a `result` or `error` key. 

A `result` of `true` indicates a match to within 4 hamming distance of a scam image. `false` indicates it is outside this range.

An `error` (and a 500 response) will explain what was wrong.

Using the test image: https://api.excessive.space/v1/hashcompare?hash=bbac1388cc534c6133166616c8f9d0193e6c36e5d3072f9994f9ccf63f823336

Will return a 200: 
```
{
  "result": true
}
```

Using an altered (non-matching) hash: https://api.excessive.space/v1/hashcompare?hash=bbac1388cc534c6133166616c8f9d0193e6c36e5d3072f9994f9ccf63f823300

Will return a 404:
```
{
  "result": false
}
```

--------

Complex endpoint: `https://api.excessive.space/v1/scamscore?hash=<64char_hash>&dimensions=<width>,<height>`

This will return json with either a `result` or `error` key. 

A `result` > `0` indicates a possible match of a scam image. `0` indicates definitely no match.

- `10` — exact match to one of the hashes
- `8` — match within 4 hamming distance
- `5-6` — match within about 6 hamming distance and/or with similar dimention ratio
- `3-4` — match within about 8 hamming distance and/or with larger dimention ratio difference
- `1-2` — match within about 10 hamming distance and/or with large dimention ratio difference
- `0` — match is outside 10 hamming distance and/or with a huge ratio difference (also denoted by a `404` being returned)

I would recommend counting anything 4+ as being a hit.

--------

To submit images directly, you can do so either with SentryBot's context menus, or with an API endpoint:

- Endpoint (POST): `https://api.excessive.space/v1/report`
- Pass the url of an image as a `url` header.
- Request (DM `.damaged` on Discord, or email me: spam-images@excessive.space) an API key, and put it in the usual `Authorization` header as a `Bearer` token.

It should look something like:
<img width="1580" height="414" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/124ff070-b64d-4253-8844-4d220c59c097" />


<img width="500" height="auto" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9906e97-127f-4928-b8d0-bd39fa867c55" />
