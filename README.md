# Scam-Images
A list of images that are known scams that get posted to chat services. Please treat these like Co-60 and don't share them on rando servers. Drop and run!

I accept PRs with new images. Please use the format (d/m/yyyy) for the folder and make an `info.txt` file to state where you found them.

Can recommend using something like [ImageHash (python)](https://pypi.org/project/ImageHash/) for comparing images. A hamming distance of ~4 should account for JPG compression without catching unrelated things.
